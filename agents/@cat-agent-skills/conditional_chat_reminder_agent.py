"""
Conditional Chat Reminder — Schedule a Teams reminder that sends only when the expected person has not already posted a relevant update.

AGGREGATED ENTRY. The content authority for this capability is the upstream
library; this file is the structured RAR container for it. It carries a
manifest, a version locked to upstream, a content hash, a provenance record and
a public feedback thread — none of which the upstream entry has on its own.

Nothing from upstream is reproduced here. perform() returns a description and a
link, so this is a catalog entry pointing home, not a copy.

  Source library : CAT Agent Skills (microsoft)
  Upstream entry : https://microsoft.github.io/cat-agent-skills/#conditional-chat-reminder
  Upstream author: Giorgio Ughini
  Upstream version: 1.0.0
  Licence        : unverified (unverified — indexed, never republished)

Regenerated automatically by scripts/generate_aggregated_agents.py whenever the
upstream record changes, so this file and its source cannot silently diverge.
