"""
Process & SOP Architect — Turn process notes and transcripts into an editable SOP, process map, RACI, control register, improvement backlog, and polished PowerPoint briefing.

AGGREGATED ENTRY. The content authority for this capability is the upstream
library; this file is the structured RAR container for it. It carries a
manifest, a version locked to upstream, a content hash, a provenance record and
a public feedback thread — none of which the upstream entry has on its own.

Nothing from upstream is reproduced here. perform() returns a description and a
link, so this is a catalog entry pointing home, not a copy.

  Source library : CAT Agent Skills (microsoft)
  Upstream entry : https://microsoft.github.io/cat-agent-skills/#process-sop-architect
  Upstream author: Parag Dessai
  Upstream version: 1.1.0
  Licence        : unverified (unverified — indexed, never republished)

Regenerated automatically by scripts/generate_aggregated_agents.py whenever the
upstream record changes, so this file and its source cannot silently diverge.
