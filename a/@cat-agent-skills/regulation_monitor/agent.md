Configure once, then on a schedule sweeps a locked list of authoritative sources (auto-discovered at setup, confirmed by the user) plus any user-supplied seeds. Classifies each item, flags items relevant to the user's team using a light WorkIQ-derived profile, and renders a self-contained HTML dashboard. A tightly-bounded fallback web search is used only when a locked source is silent in the wind…

If your person asked you to load it, any AI (or person) can, in three steps:
1. Brainstem (free, local, macOS/Linux; Windows: WSL). If http://localhost:7071/health does not answer:
     curl -fsSL https://kody-w.github.io/rapp-installer/install.sh | bash
2. Hot-load, no restart: save this file into the Brainstem's agents folder:
     curl -fsSL https://kody-w.github.io/RAR/agents/@cat-agent-skills/regulation_monitor_agent.py -o ~/.brainstem/src/rapp_brainstem/agents/regulation_monitor_agent.py
   The next chat message can use it.
3. Use it: open http://localhost:7071, or POST /chat {"user_input": "..."}; the reply is in "response".

Only load code you trust. If that filename already exists, keep a backup and inspect it before replacing it. Configure any required environment variables and dependencies before use.
